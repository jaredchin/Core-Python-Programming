Welcome to Flask’s documentation. This documentation is divided into different parts.
I recommend that you get started with Installation and then head over to the Quickstart.
Besides the quickstart, there is also a more detailed Tutorial that shows how to create a
complete (albeit small) application with Flask. If you’d rather dive into the internals of
Flask, check out the API documentation. Common patterns are described in the Patterns for
Flask section.
Flask depends on two external libraries: the Jinja2 template engine and the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit.
These libraries are not documented here. If you want to dive into their documentation, check out
the following links:
